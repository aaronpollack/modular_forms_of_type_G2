# modular_forms_of_type_G2

The main file is 'g2_motives.sage'.  It can be used to compute Fourier coefficients of two types of modular forms with Satake parameters in G2(C): Holomorphic Siegel modular forms on Sp(6) and quaternionic modular forms on split G2.  It is implemented in SAGE.  The code is associated with the mathematics in the papers "Exceptional theta functions and arithmeticity of modular forms on G_2" and "Computation of Fourier coefficients of automorphic forms of type G2".  The top of the file 'g2_motives.sage' explains how to run the code.

# jupyter_notebooks

There are 3 Juypter notebooks.  They give examples of how to use the code.  They also show the computations that are used in the paper "Computation of Fourier coefficients of automorphic forms of type G2".
